# Task classification and prioritization system ‚Äì Hospital

## üìã Brief description and context

During my internship in the electricity department, I identified a lack of structure in managing daily repair requests. The department received numerous requests, but there was no efficient method to prioritize tasks based on their urgency or complexity. 

To address this issue, I designed and developed an **automated classification system** that assigns a priority score to each request. This system was based on criteria collaboratively defined with the department manager, allowing for optimal resource allocation and better intervention planning.

The final output was presented in a double-entry table displaying:
- Task number
- Simplified description generated by the program
- Priority score based on severity
- Suggested personnel responsible for handling the task

This structured approach allowed the team to quickly prioritize and allocate resources effectively.

## üéØ Responsibilities

### Needs analysis
- Reviewed the department‚Äôs current workflow.
- Conducted interviews to define key criteria for prioritizing tasks.

### Criteria modeling
- Defined and weighted five main criteria:
  - **Severity**: 20%
  - **Patient involvement**: 30%
  - **Resources required**: 15%
  - **Time estimate**: 15%
  - **Urgency**: 20%
- Modeled the scoring system mathematically to combine criteria into a single priority score.

### System development

  - **Text preprocessing**: Cleaned and simplified task descriptions.
  - **Keyword extraction**: Automated identification of critical keywords to assess urgency.
  - **Scoring function**: Calculated priority scores based on weighted criteria.
- Developed reusable functions for scoring and data processing.

### Result presentation
- Designed a double-entry table displaying:
  - Task number
  - Simplified task description
  - Priority score
  - Suggested personnel/team for handling the task

## üñ•Ô∏è Key code

Due to the private nature of the original data and my lack of access to the actual code developed during the project, I have recreated portions of the code to demonstrate its functionality. These reproductions are simplified examples designed to illustrate the core concepts and processes of the project while maintaining confidentiality and respecting data privacy regulations.

### 1. **Text preprocessing**

This function processes and simplifies task descriptions by removing irrelevant details.

```python
def clean_text(description):

    import re
    from nltk.corpus import stopwords
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('french'))

    description = re.sub(r'\W|\d', ' ', description)
    description = description.lower()
    words = [word for word in description.split() if word not in stop_words]
    simplified_description = ' '.join(words[:5])
    return simplified_description

raw_description = "La prise √©lectrique dans la salle 203 est en panne. Cela provoque une interruption critique dans l'alimentation √©lectrique."
simplified = clean_text(raw_description)
print(simplified)


### 2. **Task Scoring Function**

This function calculates a task‚Äôs priority score based on defined weights for each criterion.

```python
def calculate_score(severity, patient_involved, resources, time_estimate, urgency):

    weights = {
        'severity': 0.2,
        'patient_involved': 0.3,
        'resources': 0.15,
        'time_estimate': 0.15,
        'urgency': 0.2
    }

    score = (weights['severity'] * severity +
             weights['patient_involved'] * patient_involved +
             weights['resources'] * resources +
             weights['time_estimate'] * time_estimate +
             weights['urgency'] * urgency)
    
    return round(score, 2)

task_score = calculate_score(severity=9, patient_involved=10, resources=5, time_estimate=7, urgency=8)
print(task_score)

### 3. **Result Display Function**

This fonction display the result.

def display_table(tasks):
    from prettytable import PrettyTable

    table = PrettyTable()
    table.field_names = ["Task Number", "Simplified Description", "Priority Score", "Suggested Personnel"]

    for task in tasks:
        table.add_row([
            task["number"],
            task["description"],
            task["score"],
            task["personnel"]
        ])

    print(table)

tasks = [
    {"number": "001", "description": "prise √©lectrique salle panne interruption", "score": 85, "personnel": "Electrician Team A"},
    {"number": "002", "description": "lampe couloir d√©fectueux r√©paration", "score": 45, "personnel": "Maintenance Technician"},
    {"number": "003", "description": "g√©n√©rateur urgence dysfonctionnement critique", "score": 95, "personnel": "Senior Engineer"}
]
