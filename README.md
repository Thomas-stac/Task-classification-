# Task Classification and Prioritization System ‚Äì St. Luc Hospital

## üìã Brief Description and Context

During my internship in the electricity department of **St. Luc Hospital** in Brussels, I identified a lack of structure in managing daily repair requests. The department received numerous requests, but there was no efficient method to prioritize tasks based on their urgency or complexity. 

To address this issue, I designed and developed an **automated classification system** that assigns a priority score to each request. This system was based on criteria collaboratively defined with the department manager, allowing for optimal resource allocation and better intervention planning.

The **final output** was presented in a **double-entry table** displaying:
- Task number
- Simplified description generated by the program
- Priority score based on severity
- Suggested personnel responsible for handling the task

This structured approach allowed the team to quickly prioritize and allocate resources effectively.

## üèÜ Achievements

- **Scoring Algorithm**: Developed an algorithm to classify repair requests based on their priority.  
- **Predictive System**: Estimated task duration and optimized team allocation.  
- **Operational Efficiency**: Minimized decision-making time and ensured prompt response to critical tasks.  
- **User-Friendly Reports**: Delivered a tool providing daily task prioritization reports in table format.  
- **Simplified Descriptions**: Used a text processing module to make task descriptions clearer.  
- **Feedback**: Received positive feedback for enhancing the workflow of the department.

## üéØ Responsibilities

### Needs Analysis
- Reviewed the department‚Äôs current workflow.
- Conducted interviews to define key criteria for prioritizing tasks.

### Criteria Modeling
- Defined and weighted five main criteria:
  - **Severity**: 20%
  - **Patient involvement**: 30%
  - **Resources required**: 15%
  - **Time estimate**: 15%
  - **Urgency**: 20%
- Modeled the scoring system mathematically to combine criteria into a single priority score.

### System Development
- Built the system in **Python** with these components:
  - **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaned and simplified task descriptions.
  - **Keyword Extraction**: Automated identification of critical keywords to assess urgency.
  - **Scoring Function**: Calculated priority scores based on weighted criteria.
- Developed reusable functions for scoring and data processing.

### Result Presentation
- Designed a **double-entry table** displaying:
  - Task number
  - Simplified task description
  - Priority score
  - Suggested personnel/team for handling the task

## üîç Sample Table Output

| Task Number | Simplified Description         | Priority Score | Suggested Personnel    |
|-------------|---------------------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| 001         | Power outage in operating room | 85             | Electrician Team A     |
| 002         | Faulty light in hallway        | 45             | Maintenance Technician |
| 003         | Emergency generator malfunction | 95            | Senior Engineer        |

## üñ•Ô∏è Key Code Snippets

Due to the private nature of the original data and my lack of access to the actual code developed during the project, I have recreated portions of the code to demonstrate its functionality. These reproductions are simplified examples designed to illustrate the core concepts and processes of the project while maintaining confidentiality and respecting data privacy regulations.

### 1. **Text Preprocessing**

This function processes and simplifies task descriptions by removing irrelevant details.

```python
def clean_text(description):
    import re
    from nltk.corpus import stopwords
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('french'))

    # Remove special characters and numbers
    description = re.sub(r'\W|\d', ' ', description)
    # Convert text to lowercase
    description = description.lower()
    # Tokenize and remove stopwords
    words = [word for word in description.split() if word not in stop_words]
    # Keep only the first few words for simplicity
    simplified_description = ' '.join(words[:5])
    
    return simplified_description

# Example Usage
raw_description = "La prise √©lectrique dans la salle 203 est en panne. Cela provoque une interruption critique dans l'alimentation √©lectrique."
simplified = clean_text(raw_description)
print("Simplified Description:", simplified)


### 2. **Task Scoring Function**

This function calculates a task‚Äôs priority score based on defined weights for each criterion.

```python
def calculate_score(severity, patient_involved, resources, time_estimate, urgency):
    # Define weights for each criterion
    weights = {
        'severity': 0.3,
        'patient_involved': 0.4,
        'resources': 0.15,
        'time_estimate': 0.1,
        'urgency': 0.05
    }

    # Calculate weighted score
    score = (weights['severity'] * severity +
             weights['patient_involved'] * patient_involved +
             weights['resources'] * resources +
             weights['time_estimate'] * time_estimate +
             weights['urgency'] * urgency)
    
    return round(score, 2)

# Example Usage
task_score = calculate_score(severity=9, patient_involved=10, resources=5, time_estimate=7, urgency=8)
print("Task Priority Score:", task_score)

### 3. **Result Display Function**

This fonction display the result.

def display_table(tasks):
    from prettytable import PrettyTable

    # Create table structure
    table = PrettyTable()
    table.field_names = ["Task Number", "Simplified Description", "Priority Score", "Suggested Personnel"]

    # Populate table with tasks
    for task in tasks:
        table.add_row([
            task["number"],
            task["description"],
            task["score"],
            task["personnel"]
        ])

    print(table)

# Example Usage
tasks = [
    {"number": "001", "description": "prise √©lectrique salle panne interruption", "score": 85, "personnel": "Electrician Team A"},
    {"number": "002", "description": "lampe couloir d√©fectueux r√©paration", "score": 45, "personnel": "Maintenance Technician"},
    {"number": "003", "description": "g√©n√©rateur urgence dysfonctionnement critique", "score": 95, "personnel": "Senior Engineer"}
]
